## Basic SQL Queries

### COUNT Queries

Count no of employees working in dept 'IT'
```sql
SELECT Conut(*) FROM Employees WHERE dept_name='IT';
```

---
### FIND Queries

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 50000;
```
---
### LIKE Queris (REGEX)

Find Names of employees starting with a
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM Employees WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%';
/* Here % means null or any no for characters */
```

Find details of employees whose first_name end in 'A' and has 6 letters
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM Employees WHERE first_name LIKE '_____A';
/* Here _ means exactly one characters */
```

### UPDATE Queries

Increase income of all employees by 5%
```sql
UPDATE Employees SET income = income + (income * 5/100);
```

## Complex SQL commands
Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses)
For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S). Eg Ariel(A) Samantha(D)
```sql
select CONCAT(Name,"(",LEFT(Occupation,1),")") from Occupations order by name;
```

Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format: There are total 2 doctors
```sql
select CONCAT("There are total ", Count(Occupation), " ", LOWER(occupation), "s.") from Occupations Group by Occupation order by  Count(Occupation)
```

### Examples on a Table

```sql
show tables;
```
```
SELECT * FROM Sales GROUP BY SalesPerson;
```

```sql
SELECT AVG(no_page) FROM book_mast;
```

```sql
SELECT MAX(Yearly_Income) AS `Maximum Income`
FROM customerdetails;
```
```sql
select name from employee where salary>2000 and months<10 order by employee_id;
```

Above SQL Query will group the Customers by their Education, and finds the highest Income in each group
```sql
SELECT  Education, MAX(Yearly_Income) FROM customerdetails GROUP BY Education;
```

Store MySQL query results in another Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE a SELECT SalesPerson,AVG(TotalSale) as b FROM Sales GROUP BY SalesPerson;
select * from a
select MAX(b) from a;
```
